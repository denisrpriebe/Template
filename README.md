# Template

The Template project is my attempt at a MVC based framework to help me get projects off the ground faster.

You may install Template with composer:

    composer create-project denisrpriebe/template -s alpha

then

    composer install
    
followed by

    composer dump-autoload -o
    
You should then run:

    bower install
    
to install bootstrap, jquery and a few other nice libraries.
